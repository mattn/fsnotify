// A path can only be watched once; attempting to watch it more than once will

// added.

// A watch will be automatically removed if the watched path is deleted or
// renamed. The exception is the Windows backend, which doesn't remove the
// watcher on renames.

// See [AddWith] for a version that allows adding options.
//
// # Watching directories
//
// All files in a directory are monitored, including new files that are created
// after the watcher is started. Subdirectories are not watched (i.e. it's
// non-recursive).
//
// # Watching files
//
// Watching individual files (rather than directories) is generally not
// recommended as many tools update files atomically. Instead of "just" writing
// to the file a temporary file will be written to first, and if successful the
// temporary file is moved to to destination removing the original, or some
// variant thereof. The watcher on the original file is now lost, as it no
// longer exists.
//
// Instead, watch the parent directory and use Event.Name to filter out files
// you're not interested in. There is an example of this in [cmd/fsnotify/file.go].

// AddWith is like [Add], but has the possibility to add options. When using
// Add() the defaults described below are used.
//
// Possible options are:
//
//   - [WithBufferSize] sets the buffer size for the Windows backend; no-op on
//     other platforms. The default is 64K (65536 bytes).
func (w *Watcher) AddWith(name string, opts ...addOpt) error {
	return nil
}

// Remove stops monitoring the path for changes.
//
// Directories are always removed non-recursively. For example, if you added
// /tmp/dir and /tmp/dir/subdir then you will need to remove both.
//
// Removing a path that has not yet been added returns [ErrNonExistentWatch].
